The corona virus disease is a major problem in the future world. Presently there is no medicine or vaccine made available in the India for general public. As there is a severe attack in this world, the people are suffering from the corona disease. The COVID-19 disease is not a simple virus attack, it makes severe to the human by infecting the respiratory system. The virus disease is heavily spreading in the world, as the nations are trying to monitor and maintain the spread of corona in the nation and other nations. The world is suffering a lot due to this corona virus.

There is a strict evaluation everywhere to control the corona disease and spread to the nation. The hospital and the nurse people are suffering to cure the affected people and stop spreading the virus to the neighbouring people.

The mask and the sanitizer are provided everywhere to protect the people from spreading the virus and to kill the virus from the human hands. The virus is spreading from the human hands and mouth saliva. The mouth spread is controlled with the mask cloth and the human hand is controlled by the hand sanitizer. The hand touch bottle while pressing the dispenser usage also spreads from human to human. There should be an automatic hand wash sanitizer dispenser, to control and maintain the spread from human to human. As there is an impact in using the hand wash sanitation by foot or by pressing the sanitizer bottle used to have a spread of the virus disease from one human to another.

A long press is made with the footer, such that the mechanical stress is made on the instrument. The mechanical stress made, is forced to spray out the Sanitizer liquid. The human at aged people is unable to use this system as there is mechanical stress and there is a sudden liquid force coming from the sanitizer bottle.

The Easy Non-Contact Automatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser or Automatic Soap Dispenser with Arduino UNO, it has the Atmega328p microcontroller to control the sanitizer liquid with the help of a Servo motor. This is used to power up the system by the external power supply of 9V battery or through computer.
